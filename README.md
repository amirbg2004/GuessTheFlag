**Guess the Flag!**
Guess The Flag! is a quiz game type project developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 
It's my first project as part of the TECHlarious & TwoOfUs L.L.C Internship Program. 
My aim from this project is to create a fun game where users can test their flag knowledge skills! 
This project was developed in a highly dynamic way. I wanted to test my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills through it.
The project only includes 10% HTML!
I hope you enjoy it!
